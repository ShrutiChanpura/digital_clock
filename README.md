# digital_clock
In this post, I will show you how to build and design your digital clock window using python. This is a simple project to get started with Tkinter, which is a built-in package that comes with Python. Tkinter is basically a graphical user interface package. It has great features that can be used to create simple applications. And today we will use it to create our digital clock.
The great part of building your own digital clock is you can customize it as you wish. From text font to background color, all the features are available to be customized.
